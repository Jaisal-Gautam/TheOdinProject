    <p> Margherita Pizza is a classic Italian pizza that embodies simplicity and fresh flavors. Originating in Naples, it was named after Queen Margherita of Savoy in 1889. The pizza represents the colors of the Italian flag with its key ingredients: red tomato sauce, white mozzarella cheese, and green fresh basil.

        Its minimalist approach highlights the quality of the ingredients, making it a favorite for purists. Traditionally baked in a wood-fired oven, the Margherita pizza is a celebration of authentic Italian culinary artistry.</p>
